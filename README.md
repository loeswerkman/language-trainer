# Welcome to the language trainer!

This repository contains a simple language learning application.

## Project vision

This project has two aims:
1. To create a simple, free interface for learning languages.
2. To create a learning ground for fullstack Kotlin programming.

For more information on the initial vision, see [initial-vision.md](docs/initial-vision.md).

## The app

The app features a minimalistic interface for learning languages.

## The code

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Web and Server.

### Folder structure

* [/app/shared](./app/shared/src) is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform
  applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
    - [commonMain](./app/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin) is for code that’s common for all targets.
    - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the
      folder name.

* [/core](./core/src) is for the code that will be shared between all targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is [commonMain](./core/src/commonMain/kotlin). If preferred, you
  can add code to the platform-specific folders here too.

* [/server](./server/src/main/kotlin) is for the Ktor server application.

### Running the apps

Use the run configurations provided by the run widget in your IDE's toolbar. You can also use these
commands and options:

- Server: `./gradlew :server:run`
- Web app:
    - Wasm target (faster, modern browsers): `./gradlew :app:webApp:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun`
    - JS target (slower, supports older browsers): `./gradlew :app:webApp:jsBrowserDevelopmentRun`

### Running tests

Use the run button in your IDE's editor gutter, or run tests using Gradle tasks:

- Server tests: `./gradlew :server:test`
- Web tests:
    - Wasm target: `./gradlew :app:shared:wasmJsTest`
    - JS target: `./gradlew :app:shared:jsTest`
